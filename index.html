      <h1>SAP ABAP & BTP Developer</h1>
      <p class="tagline">
        S/4HANA Public Cloud • RAP & Fiori Elements • BTP & API Hub • Data & Supply Chain
      </p>
      <p class="intro-main">
        As an SAP Developer with an Industrial Engineering background and a strong interest in supply chain,
        I focus on building solutions that make both technical and business sense. After three months of training at
        Hand Indonesia, I became the first one from my batch trusted to handle a project, moreover a SAP S/4HANA Public
        Cloud project,
        which was also the first Public Cloud project on Indonesia's Branch. In this project
        I worked daily with CDS, RAP, BTP, BAS, Fiori, API Hub, and other apps which resonate with developers side,
        and even with a language barrier with the business consultant
        I could still discuss the design, suggest how the development should go, and keep the solution realistic for the
        users and
        for the current technology.
      </p>
      <p class="intro-sub">
        My main strengths are SAP backend development across both classical ABAP (OOP, Dynpro, RFC)
        and S/4HANA Public Cloud, with hands-on experience in complex data retrieval, JavaScript-based custom actions,
        and API-driven posting logic.
