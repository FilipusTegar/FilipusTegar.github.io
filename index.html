      <h1>SAP ABAP & BTP Developer</h1>

        S/4HANA Public Cloud • RAP & Fiori Elements • BTP & API Hub • Data & Supply Chain
      </p>
      <p class="intro-main">
        As an SAP Developer with an Industrial Engineering background and a strong interest in supply chain,
        I focus on building solutions that make both technical and business sense. After three months of training at
        Hand Indonesia, I became the first one from my batch trusted to handle a project, moreover a SAP S/4HANA Public
        Cloud project,
        which was also the first Public Cloud project on Indonesia's Branch. In this project
        I worked daily with CDS, RAP, BTP, BAS, Fiori, API Hub, and other apps which resonate with developers side,
        and even with a language barrier with the business consultant
        I could still discuss the design, suggest how the development should go, and keep the solution realistic for the
        users and
        for the current technology.
      </p>
      <p class="intro-sub">
        My main strengths are SAP backend development across both classical ABAP (OOP, Dynpro, RFC)
        and S/4HANA Public Cloud, with hands-on experience in complex data retrieval, JavaScript-based custom actions,
        and API-driven posting logic.

          <span>S/4HANA Public Cloud • RAP • Custom Entities (LR - OP) • Fiori Elements</span>
        </div>

        <small>
          Business context: helps a retail chain calculate sales deduction/commission amounts per contract
          and see total rebates and commissions by month, quarter, and year in one place.
        </small>

        <ul>
          <li>
            Modeled three RAP custom entities (monthly, quarterly, yearly), each aggregating data by
            contract number and exposing them as multiple views in a single List Report/Object Page.
          </li>
          <li>
            Designed CDS view entities with grouping on contract number and period, plus computed fields
            for deduction and commission amounts.
          </li>
          <li>
            Designed drill down relevant Sales Documents within same interval, contract number and storage location.
          </li>
          <li>
            Used BAS on BTP as the main environment for development, configuration, and deployment.

        <div class="card-lessons">
          <h4>Lessons Learned & Improvements</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Refined the data model for deduction ratio step to differ one ratio to another (Propose simple yet
              efective key based on my tax knowledge).
            </li>
            <li>
              Proposing multiple tab views implementation rather than selecting using dropdown filter selection.
            </li>
            <li>
              Improved the drill-down design to keep filters consistent when jumping from header view to document-level
              details to create faster validation.
            </li>
            <li>
              Tuned filter, restrictions, aggregations and annotations to keep response time acceptable on larger
              datasets.
            </li>

        <small>Business context: investigate inventory materials level on all storage location quickly and can be
          drilled down from a high-level list into detailed
          conditions.</small>
        <ul>
          <li>Configured an advanced Object Page that automatically applies filter conditions based on the selected List
            Report record.</li>
          <li>Used UI annotations to control facets, sections, and field visibility for different analysis needs.</li>
          <li>Implemented logic to sync list selection, detail filters, and related entity data to support faster
            inventory analysis.</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="card-lessons">
          <h4>Lessons Learned & Improvements</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Introduced an Object Page navigation and validation flow that was not in the original functional
              specification, so users can jump directly from summary lines into detailed checks.
            </li>
            <li>
              Separated key validation data into Object Page tabs for each material and storage location, covering price
              (standard and actual), opening, inbound, outbound, closing, and transit quantities and amounts.
            </li>
            <li>
              Optimized CDS queries and associations to include edge cases such as transit and unusual records across
              storage locations, while keeping performance stable by validating each change with SQL Trace.

              Improved separation between UI logic (JS and fragments) and RAP business logic to make
              the solution easier to maintain and extend.
            </li>
            <li>
              Enhanced validation and error handling for file upload and posting steps, so business
              users get clearer feedback and can fix data issues faster.
            </li>
            <li>
              Standardized the Excel template structure and naming to simplify future onboarding of
